### 1. Clone the Repository


# ✨ Important:
- **Change `your-username`** with your GitHub username if you want to copy-paste directly.
- **You can also modify** database name, username, password according to your system.
- If you want, I can also give you a **fancier README** with badges, emojis, and more stylish GitHub formatting later!

Would you also like me to create a **`.gitignore`** file for you? (so you don't push unnecessary files like `target/` folder?)  
If yes, just say "**yes gitignore also**" 🚀
